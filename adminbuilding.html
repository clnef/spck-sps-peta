<!--Information-->

        <p><h2 align=center>The Admin Building, which <mark>provides almost every paperwork that you need in the process</mark>, for transferring, enrolling, and many more.</h2></p>
    
    <p align=center>This is where teachers enter and exit, the Principal's Office, and you probably don't know what's inside this building because this is only accessible if you are lucky enough to have a teacher who ordered you to do something requiring you entering this building!</p>
    
    <p align=center>Are you <b>looking</b> for this building? This building immediately appears on the <mark>right side</mark> after entering the gate. This is also behind the guardhouse.</p>
    
    <p><h4 align=center>hope this helps! ;)</h4></p>
